Classes for types of data
==================

Here are listed all the data classes available in csi. These include geodetic data (static and time series) that can be used in conjonction with fault classes. Note that only static data classes can be used for slip inversions currently. We are working on some very simple kinematic inversion procedure and on some less simple ones...
