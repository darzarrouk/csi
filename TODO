. Verify the computeEquivPatch routine. It behaves weird for the Himalaya case...
. Add uncertainties on the covariance plots (standard deviations, for instance)
. Incorporate EDKS correctly in csi (stop writing stuff and pass arrays)
. Make sure parameters are positive in imagecovariance
. Write a profile factory so that each object does not have its own routine
