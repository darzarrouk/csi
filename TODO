1. Verify the computeEquivPatch routine. It behaves weird for the Himalaya case...
2. Add uncertainties on the covariance plots (standard deviations, for instance)
3. Add plotting of continents fill in geodetic plot 3D fault (pass a Polygon list into a Collection of 3D polygons).
4. Incorporate EDKS correctly in csi (stop writing stuff and pass arrays)
5. Make sure parameters are positive in imagecovariance
