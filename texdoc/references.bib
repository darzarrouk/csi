	Abstract = {Variations in the refractive index of the atmosphere cause variations in satellite-based interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) observations. We can mitigate tropospheric effects by averaging N-independent interferograms. Because the neutral atmosphere is uncorrelated at timescales longer than 1 day, using this technique statistically reduces the variance, \&{\#}963;2, of the noise by a factor of N. Using zenith neutral atmospheric delays from Global Positioning System (GPS) data from the Southern California Integrated GPS Network, we find that the average variance depends on the distance between observations, L, and height difference, H, as \&{\#}963; = c L\&{\#}945; + kH with estimated values for c, \&{\#}945;, and k of about 2.5, 0.5, and 4.8, respectively, where \&{\#}963; is in mm and L and H are in km. We expect that the value of \&{\#}945; is largely site-independent but the value of c will depend on the water vapor variability of the area of interest. This model is valid over a range of L between approximately 10 and 800 km. Height differences between 0 and 3 km have been used in this analysis. For distances of 100 and 10 km with negligible height differences, \&{\#}963; is estimated to be approximately 25 and 8 mm, respectively. For a given orbit revisit time and image archive duration, we calculate the number and duration (assumed constant) of interferograms required to achieve a desired sensitivity to deformation rate at a given length scale. Assuming neutral atmosphere is the dominant source of noise, a 30âˆžlook angle, and an image revisit time of 7 days, detection of a deformation rate of 1 mm yr\&{\#}8722;1 over distances of 10 km requires about 2.2 years of continuous observations. Given our results, we suggest a data covariance structure to use when using InSAR data to constrain geophysical models.},

	Abstract = {{The Haiyuan fault is part of a major left-lateral fault system at the
   northeastern edge of the Tibet-Qinghai plateau. Two M8 earthquakes
   (1920 and 1927) occurred along the fault, bracketing an unbroken
   section of the fault identified as the Tianzhu seismic gap. We use
   interferometric synthetic aperture radar data from descending orbits of
   the ERS satellites, acquired between 1993 and 1998 along two adjacent
   tracks covering the gap, to measure the current surface movements and
   better understand the present day mechanical behavior of this fault
   section. The analysis of the radar data involves first the combined
   correction of orbital errors and errors associated with the phase delay
   through the troposphere. A subset of the data is then selected based on
   the analysis of the residual noise spectra for each pair of data. The
   selected interferograms are stacked and the average phase change rate
   is converted in fault-parallel velocity assuming that the ground
   movement is horizontal and parallel to the fault. Velocity maps from
   both tracks show a zone of high velocity gradient across the fault, a
   few kilometers wide, consistent with left-lateral slip on the Haiyuan
   fault. The average velocity field from the two tracks in their
   overlapping area is well fit with a single screw dislocation model in
   an elastic half-space. The derived fault slip rate at depth (4.2-8
   mm/yr) is consistent with recent GPS results. The corresponding shallow
   apparent locking depth (0-4.2 km) can be explained by a current low
   stress accumulation on the fault due to creep almost on the entire
   fault plane. However, unless it is transient, this creep Would be
   paradoxical with the occurrence of past large earthquakes along this
   fault section, as revealed by paleoseismology. An alternative model,
   implying both shallow creep in the brittle upper crust and deep
   aseismic slip beneath the seismogenic layer, separated by a locked
   section, would be consistent with InSAR observations and with the
   potential for large earthquakes on the fault as well. A two-dislocation
   model with slip at 5 mm/yr beneath 15 km and a transient creep rate of
   11 mm/yr between 2 and 7 km fits the InSAR data. However, the width and
   creep rate of the shallow creeping zone and their possible along-strike
   variations are still poorly resolved with the present data set. (c)

	Abstract = {{We measure ground motion around the Lake Mead, Nevada, using synthetic
   aperture radar interferometry. The lake water level has fluctuated
   through time since impoundment in 1935. To quantify the deformation due
   to water level variations over the past decade, and to constrain the
   crust and mantle rheological parameters in the lake area, we analyze
   241 interferograms based on 43 ERS images acquired between 1992 and
   2002. All interferograms have a high coherence due to arid conditions.
   Most of them show strong atmospheric artefacts. Tropospheric phase
   delays are estimated and corrected for each interferogram by analyzing
   the phase/elevation correlation. Corrections are validated using data
   from the ERA40 global atmospheric reanalysis. Corrected interferograms
   are inverted pixel by pixel to solve for the time series of ground
   motion in the lake area. Temporal smoothing is added to reduce random
   atmospheric artefacts. The observed deformation is nonlinear in time
   and spreads over a 50 x 50 km(2) area. We observe a 16 mm subsidence
   between 1995 and 1998 due to an 11 m water level increase, followed by
   an uplift due to the water level drop after 2000. We model the
   deformation, taking into account the loading history of the lake since
   1935. A simple elastic model with parameters constrained by seismic
   wave velocities does not explain the amplitude of the observed motion.
   The two-layer viscoelastic model proposed by Kaufmann and Amelung
   (2000), with a mantle viscosity of 10(18) Pa s, adjusts well the data
   amplitude and its spatiotemporal shape.}},

	Abstract = {We invert 115 differential interferograms derived from 47 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) scenes for a time-dependent deformation signal in the Santa Clara valley, California. The time-dependent deformation is calculated by performing a linear inversion that solves for the incremental range change between SAR scene acquisitions. A nonlinear range change signal is extracted from the ERS InSAR data without imposing a model of the expected deformation. In the Santa Clara valley, cumulative land uplift is observed during the period from 1992 to 2000 with a maximum uplift of 41 +/- 18 mm centered north of Sunnyvale. Uplift is also observed east of San Jose. Seasonal uplift and subsidence dominate west of the Silver Creek fault near San Jose with a maximum peak-to-trough amplitude of ~35 mm. The pattern of seasonal versus long-term uplift provides constraints on the spatial and temporal characteristics of water-bearing units within the aquifer. The Silver Creek fault partitions the uplift behavior of the basin, suggesting that it acts as a hydrologic barrier to groundwater flow. While no tectonic creep is observed along the fault, the development of a low-permeability barrier that bisects the alluvium suggests that the fault has been active since the deposition of Quaternary units.},

	Abstract = {Studies of interseismic strain accumulation are crucial to our understanding of continental deformation, the earthquake cycle and seismic hazard. By mapping small amounts of ground deformation over large spatial areas, InSAR has the potential to produce continental-scale maps of strain accumulation on active faults. However, most InSAR studies to date have focused on areas where the coherence is relatively good (e.g. California, Tibet and Turkey) and most analysis techniques (stacking, small baseline subset algorithm, permanent scatterers, etc.) only include information from pixels which are coherent throughout the time-span of the study. In some areas, such as Alaska, where the deformation rate is small and coherence very variable, it is necessary to include information from pixels which are coherent in some but not all interferograms. We use a three-stage iterative algorithm based on distributed scatterer interferometry. We validate our method using synthetic data created using realistic parameters from a test site on the Denali Fault, Alaska, and present a preliminary result of 10.5 +/- 5.0 mm yr(-1) for the slip rate on the Denali Fault based on a single track of radar data from ERS1/2.},

@article{doin2009,
	Abstract = {{The main limiting factor on the accuracy of Interferometric SAR
   measurements (InSAR) comes from phase propagation delays through the
   troposphere. The delay can be divided into a stratified component,
   which correlates with the topography and often dominates the
   tropospheric signal, and a turbulent component. We use Global
   Atmospheric Models (GAM) to estimate the stratified phase delay and
   delay-elevation ratio at epochs of SAR acquisitions, and compare them
   to observed phase delay derived from SAR interferograms. Three test
   areas are selected with different geographic and climatic environments
   and with large SAR archive available. The Lake Mead, Nevada, USA is
   covered by 79 ERS1/2 and ENVISAT acquisitions, the Haiyuan Fault area,
   Gansu, China, by 24 ERS1/2 acquisitions, and the Afar region, Republic
   of Djibouti, by 91 Radarsat acquisitions. The hydrostatic and wet
   stratified delays are computed from GAM as a function of atmospheric
   pressure P, temperature T, and water vapor partial pressure e vertical
   profiles. The hydrostatic delay, which depends on ratio P/T varies
   significantly at low elevation and cannot be neglected. The wet
   component of the delay depends mostly on the near surface specific
   humidity. CAM predicted delay-elevation ratios are in good agreement
   with the ratios derived from InSAR data away from deforming zones. Both
   estimations of the delay-elevation ratio can thus be used to perform a
   first order correction of the observed interferometric phase to
   retrieve a ground motion signal of low amplitude. We also demonstrate
   that aliasing of daily and seasonal variations in the stratified delay
   due to uneven sampling of SAR data significantly bias InSAR data stacks
   or time series produced after temporal smoothing. In all three test
   cases, the InSAR data stacks or smoothed time series present a residual
   stratified delay of the order of the expected deformation signal. In
   all cases, correcting interferograms from the stratified delay removes
   all these biases. We quantify the standard error associated with the
   correction of the stratified atmospheric delay. It varies from one site
   to another depending on the prevailing atmospheric conditions, but
   remains bounded by the standard deviation of the daily fluctuations of
   the stratified delay around the seasonal average. Finally we suggest
   that the phase delay correction can potentially be improved by
   introducing a non-linear dependence to the elevation derived from GAM.

	Abstract = {{In Mexico City, subsidence rates reach up to 40 cm/yr mainly due to
   soil compaction led by the over exploitation of the Mexico Basin
   aquifer. In this paper, we map the spatial and temporal patterns of the
   Mexico City subsidence by differential radar interferometry, using 38
   ENVISAT images acquired between end of 2002 and beginning of 2007. We
   present the severe interferogram unwrapping problems partly due to the
   coherence loss but mostly due to the high fringe rates. These
   difficulties are overcome by designing a new methodology that helps the
   unwrapping step. Our approach is based on the fact that the deformation
   shape is stable for similar time intervals during the studied period.
   As a result, a stack of the five best interferograms can be used to
   compute an average deformation rate for a fixed time interval. Before
   unwrapping, the number of fringes is then decreased in wrapped
   interferograms using a scaled version of the stack together with the
   estimation of the atmospheric phase contribution related with the
   troposphere vertical stratification. The residual phase, containing
   less fringes, is more easily unwrapped than the original interferogram.
   The unwrapping procedure is applied in three iterative steps. The 71
   small baseline unwrapped interferograms are inverted to obtain
   increments of radar propagation delays between the 38 acquisition
   dates. Based on the redundancy of the interferometric data base, we
   quantify the unwrapping errors and show that they are strongly
   decreased by iterations in the unwrapping process. A map of the RMS
   interferometric system misclosure allows to define the unwrapping
   reliability for each pixel. Finally, we present a new algorithm for
   time series analysis that differs from classical SVD decomposition and
   is best suited to the present data base. Accurate deformation time
   series are then derived over the metropolitan area of the city with a
   spatial resolution of 30 x 30 m. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights
